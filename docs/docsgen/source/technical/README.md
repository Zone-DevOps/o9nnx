## Usage

### Viewing Documentation
The architecture documentation is integrated into the main ONNX documentation build system. To view:

```bash
# Build documentation
cd docs/docsgen
make html

# Open in browser
open build/html/technical/architecture.html
```

### Contributing
When contributing to the architecture documentation:

1. **Use Mermaid Syntax**: All diagrams should use Mermaid format for consistency
2. **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for components
3. **Maintain Visual Consistency**: Follow the established color scheme and styling
4. **Update Multiple Views**: Consider if changes affect multiple architecture documents
5. **Test Rendering**: Verify diagrams render correctly in the documentation build

### Mermaid Syntax Reference

The documentation uses various Mermaid diagram types:

- **Graph Diagrams**: `graph TB` for hierarchical component relationships
- **Flowcharts**: `flowchart TD` for process flows
- **Sequence Diagrams**: `sequenceDiagram` for interaction patterns
- **State Diagrams**: `stateDiagram-v2` for state transitions
